## Project Overview
This project analyzes licking behavior of mice in a Pavlovian conditioning task to predict individual learning speeds using Day 1 behavioral features. Our results highlight structured changes in licking patterns and individual variability, demonstrating the potential of data-driven approaches in animal learning research.

## Repository Structure
- **Dataset**
  - Behavioral recordings of 18 mice over 5 days
  - Features tables for all animals for 5 days
  - 2D PCA results for each of the 5 days
- **Code**
  - Jupyter Notebook containing the full data processing pipeline and visualizations
  - Python scripts for:
    - Feature extraction
    - PCA
    - Clustering
    - Learning trajectory analysis (Euclidean distance)
    - Classification model
- **Documentation**
  - Final project report

## Usage
Clone this repository and run the Jupyter notebook in the `Code` folder to reproduce the analysis.  
Ensure all dependencies listed in your environment are installed before running.
